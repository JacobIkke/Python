<h3>Python scripts</h3>
<p>I frequently created Python scripts for my electronic projects, but unfortunately, I often found misplace or accidentally delete these scripts after some time had passed. Therefore, I realized it would be better to put  them here for anyone to use, and to prevent any further losses. ðŸ˜‹ </p>
<br />NTC thermistor Calculation Script.py
<br />Simple tool to calculate/simulate NTC thermistor and ADC calculations
<br />
<br />SineWave Lockup Table Generator script V1.py
<br />This script generate a sine wave lock up table, put the values in a uint16 C array. Option are ampitude, size and how many number per row.
<br />
<br />LED Voltage Drop Calculator.py
<br />Calculate the voltage drop of LEDs, single or in series, will calculate resistor, power disipation in led and resistor, etc
<br />
<br />serial_monitor_v02.py
<br />Simple serial monitor application using the Tkinter library in Python. 
<br />
<br />one instruction CPU sim
<br />Introducing the One-Instruction CPU Simulatorâ€”a remarkable innovation that can accomplish everything a normal CPU can with just a single instruction: NAND. Despite its seemingly limited instruction set, this simulator defies expectations by leveraging the NAND gate to perform a wide range of tasks, replicating the functionality of CPUs with tens or even thousands of instructions.
