<h3>Python scripts</h3>
<p>I frequently created Python scripts for my electronic projects, but unfortunately, I often found misplace or accidentally delete these scripts after some time had passed. Therefore, I realized it would be better to put  them here for anyone to use, and to prevent any further losses. ðŸ˜‹ </p>
